> The goal of our service is to offer a web page where people can obtain more knowledge about mushrooms or check about the mushrooms obtained. Hence, our site will be divided between a gallery containing mushrooms where the user will be able to access for more knowledge about specific mushrooms and a machine learning image classifier.
