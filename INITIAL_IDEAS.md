### CRAZIER IDEAS

- **Classifier of mushrooms (API or tensorflowjs?)- aqui se explica lo de que fuimos a Nuuksio y no  teniamos ni idea y había un montón de setas **
  - en plan foro donde la gente hace posts de lo que ha encontrado
  - mapas donde encontrar más (actualizados por la info de la gente)
  - información, targetas de cada seta 

### EXCHANGE STUDENTS

- **Creator of timetables** 
- **Website that tells you where you should go to eat in the University depending on what you like or your needs**
- Website to give away stuff for free by zone (DIBS), telegram is a mess*
- There's always people having lunch alone; that is sad. Maybe a web that matches randomly people in order to have lunch everyday you want to  with somebody new. [TAKEN] :cry:

### ACTUALLY USEFUL

- Web App where the town hall's of a city can post activities they are planning to do. Also, the citizens can upload photos of damaged parts of the city (such as street's paviments, fallen trees...) so that the town hall can repair the damaged things. Or only for the university (group al types of activities in the university, group them in faculties).
- *Website where any restaurant can post the food that was not able to sell but cheaper in order not to waste food.*
- Planner for visiting places in Helsinki? i.e. create packs of trips (food trip xD, churches trip, bad trip :))))))))))))))))))) )



- Creator of websites (kinda like Figma)
- Gallery where if you take a photo and it detects a friend's face automatically it's shared with them.
- Air ping pong game
